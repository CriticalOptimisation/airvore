	Transportation means powered by fossil fuels, such as gasoline, fuel, diesel, or kerosene &ndash; 
	cars, trucks, airplanes, ships, and some trains &ndash; contribute to climate change because 
	<strong>fossil carbon</strong>, trapped underground for millions of years in the form of oil, 
	is released into the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub> when burned in a vehicle's engine.</p>
	<p>
	This gas is present in small amounts in the atmosphere, where it accumulates even if some is
	absorbed by oceans and vegetation through natural balances. <strong>The greenhouse effect</strong> 
	refers to its influence on the climate, with a general trend of warming and local climate changes 
	likely to cause political upheavals due to flooding, drought, migration or decrease in crops 
	(hail or displacement of harmful species). The climate disruption caused by CO<sub>2</sub> is 
	cumulative and irreversible at the timescale of a human life, which is why we must drastically 
	reduce the use of fossil fuels.</p>
	<p>
	But that's not the only impact. The ocean becomes more acidic by absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> and 
	marine life is directly affected: some mollusks have difficulty producing their shell, which 
	affects the entire food chain. In addition other emissions directly or indirectly linked to
	transportation reinforce the greenhouse effect and cause air pollution."""
